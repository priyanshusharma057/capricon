            Industrial training is very essential. The student gets a chance to learn new technologies.
            A university is generally not in tune with the latest industry requirements.In engineering and many other
            courses Industrial training is very important.This helps the student to gain industrial exposure and also get familiar with the environment of the corporate world he/she wishes to enter.
            But the most important fact about industrial training is that it should be taken very seriously both by students as well as trainers.

        </p>
            <p class="align pt-2">
                When it comes to traning there is six month training and six week training. Both six week and six month are important.
                As we know in your university/college students do a lot of theoretical work so training is very important to apply your knowledge in live projects and to do work with the professionals.
                In addition to the technical skill accomplishment the particular candidate is also groomed on communication Skills, interpersonal skills, working in a team and leadership skills. 
                These skills are very important while applying for a job. We provide training in many technologies wheather it is front end or backend.

            6 week of training is as much important as the 6 month training for a student. As in the perod of your graduation you won't we able to get many 6 month of training 
            but as we know 6 week is less time period a normal graduate have done it 2-3 times. So in this type of training you will able to know the work environment well and 
            started working on the small projects. If a student completed its 6 week training then its much easier for him/her to start the work during the 6 month training. The
            technologies you will learn will help you get land in the good job.
            </p>
